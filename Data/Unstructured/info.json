Active learning methodologies, which prioritize student engagement and hands-on experiences, are paramount in preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\nNumerous higher education institutions in India are embracing these progressive approaches and making substantial contributions to the advancement of education, both domestically and on the international stage. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has set an ambitious target of achieving a 50% Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035, placing a greater responsibility on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to provide quality education and training to a larger student population.\nChandigarh University, guided by its motto \"to discover, learn, and empower,\" is resolutely committed to offering students an unparalleled educational experience.

We have adopted a world-leading Learning Management System to ensure hassle-free and uninterrupted learning when the physical mode of learning is not feasible.\n\n\nAs the Pro Vice Chancellor, I bring a rich diverse experience of academics, research, corporate and defense. That includes having seen 2 IITs, 2 IIITs, 2 private universities, Microsoft IDC, and as CEO of a global IT Company and also as an IAF officer. But my profound passion is higher education, research, and entrepreneurship.

I firmly believe that the education transcends beyond textbooks and classrooms. Also, I am deeply committed to provide well-rounded educational experience to our students, that equips them with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in an ever-changing world and be a valuable global citizen.\nIn the world, where the landscapes of technologies and paradigms in all walks of life have been changing fast, it is important for each of us to keep ourselves ahead of the curve, relevant and futuristic. We all academicians and students not only need to keep us updated of the latest developments in respective fields, but possibly also be contributors to these domains.

As we march towards new milestones, I invite you to join us in this exciting journey of learning and transformation at Chandigarh University.\n\n\nAs the Pro Vice Chancellor-Research, I want to establish a strong research ecosystem by cultivating and fostering interdisciplinary high-impact research in partnerships with external organizations, industry, government agencies, and community groups to amplify the research impact and outcome of Chandigarh University. Therefore, I look at this opportunity not as an accomplishment but some big shoes to fill. I am confident I would do justice because of my capacity to learn, lead and share. My doors are open to you always. May you all continue to be success in your R&D endeavours!\n\nIt is a matter of honor and immense pleasure to lead the most prestigious and esteemed Chandigarh University as a Pro-Vice Chancellor- Research.\nDriven by exponential progress in Science & Technology (S&T), the world is increasingly moving towards an innovation economy. To be a global leader in S&T, India needs to create pioneering research and develop an ecosystem that supports its translation for the good in sculpting the economy and society, thereby ensuring that our sustained economic growth is not  just service sector centric but uses cutting edge technology applications for the social good. Indian science has done well in the last decade and a half, especially when compared to the last two decades of the 20th century. The first decade of this century saw the second era of scientific institution building, the initial one being the two decades after Independence. Purely by statistics, the quantity and quality of research in STEM is going up but the weaknesses of Indian Science are still as stark as ever in general, barring top notch institutions. This impression can continue to flourish provided the leading institutions like Chandigarh University with a demonstrated history of one century are well furnished with competences to create a sustainable and innovative future.\nAs I assume the role of steering the University Centre for Research and Development (UCRD) at Chandigarh University, I find it to be a focused unassumingly vibrant unit fostering research eco-system, that cut across all the verticals of S&T per-se, humanities (including commerce), management and all other cognitive sciences, one can think of in such an esteemed instituition of repute. This is being achieved seamlessly by facilitating, planning, implementation, and monitoring of research activities such as information and databases, research publications, patents, sponsored grants, IPRs, international collaborations, and importantly all type of outreach and reachout activities by the faculties, research scholars and other students.\nUCRD acts as a facilitator for the various schools and departments to promote inter-disciplinary, trans-disciplinary, and multidisciplinary research culture. It is also responsible for developing policies and procedures that govern R&D activities, including ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects or animals, research incentive policies, data management policies, knowledge dissemination policies, networking & collaboration with industries, and institutions of eminense for the benefit of faculty, students, industry and other stakeholders.\nGlobally speaking there are many R&D funding agencies who do not have specific policies supporting interdisciplinary research. Therefore talking on the subject may be nice, but the need is to walk the talk that too judiciously. The need is also to build a resilient research ecosystem by grooming young talents that can help replenish the void created as a result of superannuated faculties. At the same time, handholding the veterans who continue to be a source of inspiration because of their continued involment in the research for the young minds. Attracting and retaining talent was a challenge long before the pandemic, but the health crisis has reinforced those demands.\nTo reimagine and redesign an innovative research ecosystem in the Chandigarh University; the need is to create the strategic roadmaps that are aligned with the aspirational goals of 21st century education. This transformation perhaps is the need of the hour to not only capitalise on innovation, but importantly delivering excellent teaching and learning in line with our NEP 2020.\n\n\nAs the Registrar, I have a distinguished career of more than 18 years as an academician in various Government Colleges and as an Educational Administrator for 10 years with the Directorate of Higher Education to the Government of Punjab where I successfully managed all 13 branches under the Directorate of Higher Education. As a concrete demonstration of extraordinary passion and commitment for my work, I recognise being the strong and proactive part of the University Management.\n\nAs the Registrar in Chandigarh University, It takes immense pride in being a part of this esteemed University of Punjab flourished into a beacon of excellence, which is dedicated to academic excellence, research, and the overall development of its students.

As an active agent of social change, CU takes on voluntary actions in the creation of a culture of social responsibility in society through a myriad of activities that address both own competitive interests & the welfare of the society.\nThe Ministry of Tourism launched a special initiative called Hunar Se Rozgar Tak (HSRT).

It aims to increase the green cover of the State of Punjab. The project is bringing respite to the ecology without imposing any financial burden on the state.\r\n\nMother earth that has already lost much of its forestlands - is the major concern of the hour. As an initiative to make the world a greener place, Chandigarh University solely or in association with different organizations often organizes a couple of Tree Plantation Drives. The purpose of this initiative is to grow more and more trees on the campus and surrounding areas.\r\n\nAs the festival of light comes, there come the exorbitant firecrackers that give us nothing but massive air pollution - this is what volunteers of Chandigarh University attempt to spread. Under ISR, they are spreading the message among the natives to avoid crackers and take the festival as an opportunity to reconnect with family.\r\n\nExhorting to fulfil Mahatma Gandhi's vision of Clean India, Chandigarh University often organizes cleanliness drives in varied areas of Kharar, Mohali under the Swachh Bharat initiative that seeks to create a Clean India.
