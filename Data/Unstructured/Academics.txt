The examination system of Chandigarh University has been designed keeping in view the best available options of evaluation & certification along with their global acceptability. The basic principle of the system is that it is “scientific, objective and transparent” with the least possibility of subjectivity caused due to the individual evaluator, particular subject, or a particular batch of students.
The examination system is divided as follows:
1. Internal Assessment: It includes 1st hourly test, 2nd hourly test, surprise test, quiz, tutorials, and assignments.
2. External Assessment: At the end of semester, a final examination is conducted to evaluate a student’s performance.
The salient features of the examination system are listed below:
Any student found to be using unfair means including talking to each other, getting any kind of help from outside, carrying any written material or mobile phone inside the examination hall etc, shall be awarded punishment varying from cancellation of one paper up to disqualification from any examination up to two years. For this purpose a special committee for prevention of unfair means (CPUM) is constituted.
CGPA is the weighted average of all the grades awarded to the student since his/her entry into the university up to and including latest semester. CGPA =; Ci = Credits for ith paper Gi = Grade points of the grade earned in ith paper
A student will be allowed to continue in the program only if, at the end of first year he/she secures CGPA of 3.5 or more or earns 40% of the credits offered in first year, similarly at the end of 2nd year. He/she secures CGPA of greater than or equal to 4.50 or earns 40% of the credits offered during Ist and IInd year. Lateral Entry students are treated as second year students. Students who are unable to fulfill the minimum requirement of CGPA shall lose one year.
In case of Post Graduation, minimum required CGPA at the end of first year is 4.50 or earning of 40% credits offered in first year. Students who are unable to fulfill this requirement shall lose one year.

The minimum CGPA required for the award of all Post-graduate degrees is 5.0.
