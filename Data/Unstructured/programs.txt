Message from Director, UILAH
Director UILAH
I am happy to share about University Institute of Liberal Arts and Humanities (UILAH) of Chandigarh University, which blends modern education with cutting edge technology in its curriculum. Liberal Arts classes focus on developing soft skills, like formulating arguments, solving problems, communicating, or analysing ideas, problems, and solutions. Liberal Arts is broader, and it includes Humanities, as well as other subdisciplines, like Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Mathematics. This allows Liberal Arts students to develop the soft skills we’ve already mentioned (critical thinking, problem-solving), which can be applied at any job.
An open dialogue for thought-provoking discussion on liberal ideals and progressive values. Embarking on a journey into the heart of liberal thought, exploring its core principles, the evolving landscape of liberal ideas, and the imperative role it plays in shaping societies around the world, Liberal Talks assists to explore forward-thinking discourse. It is a philosophy that champions the idea that diverse perspectives and inclusive policies are the bedrock of a flourishing society.

My undergraduate education in Economics at Chandigarh University was a truly enriching experience. The faculty members at the university were not just teachers, but mentors who went above and beyond to help me achieve my goals. They instilled in me a deep love for learning and provided me with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed.

At UNA, we are inspired to go above and beyond. I have applied for a dual degree program where I will be graduate with CSE and Aerospace Engineering degree from UNA and University of Alabama. I have received scholarship on tuitions fees of 3000$/year and full housing scholarship. The UNA community is very welcoming and relaxed, always there to help whenever need be! I have interned with Office of International Relations for one semester and based on the experience I gained, UNA International Affairs have recruited me for part-time job in campus.
For me studying abroad had been an unreachable and impossible goal, so I did not ever spend time dreaming about the world. When I came to know about the transfer programs in CU, me and my friends applied, not believing that we will get through it. Without any competitive exam and at a very affordable cost, I easily got admission, and before I knew it, I was packing up for this lifetime opportunity to complete my degree at A-State university USA! Life has been unpredictable in my case and I am so grateful for it!
The company has the mentally that the guest is their number one focus and we, as cast members, are here to create happiness for all that enters. The management truly invested in me and took my thoughts and feeling into consideration whenever they could. My job with this company was the most rewarding job I have had the pleasure of doing. Every day was a new adventure that led me to meet wonderful guest and fellow cast members.
Pursuing a Master's degree was a goal but getting 100% government scholarship for it was a dream made true! Global Korean scholarship has made my education and living in South Korea completely free. I was an exchange student previously at Chung Ang University and then I applied for a Master's. I chose this university for several reasons. It is not only tech advanced but it has sped up its pace in innovative teaching methods. The hard work of student is appreciated and encouraged. So many activities and events are conducted that helps in our personal and professional growth.
My time in South Korea was a great learning experience. Chung Ang University has its own Start-Up Hub that encourages and supports student’s ideas. The whole university is wired, and the students can use the computer facilities in the campus to access the Internet and to use word-processing programs. The university is technologically advanced and engaging campus activities & events.
I studied for a semester and interned for the next in South Korea. The internship at Urban Tablet of Actualized Architecture Arcadia (UTAA) fulfilled most of my goals. I worked on the conceptual planning and mass modelling of the buildings. I developed my skills in many programs such as Adobe Illustrator, PS, AutoCAD, Sketchup and I even learned a new program- Revit and Rhino basics. The experience of working at UTAA has enriched me greatly. Working with real Professionals, practicing my skills and knowledge gained at school and to learn a lot of new things, I could probably never have learned in school.

So many activities and events are conducted that helps in our personal and professional growth.
