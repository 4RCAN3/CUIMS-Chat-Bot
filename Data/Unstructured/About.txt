I am deeply honored to assume the role of Vice-Chancellor at Chandigarh University. My dedication lies in furthering the university's ongoing progress and prosperity.
In today's swiftly changing global educational landscape, it is imperative for institutions to adapt and innovate. Active learning methodologies, which prioritize student engagement and hands-on experiences, are paramount in preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
Numerous higher education institutions in India are embracing these progressive approaches and making substantial contributions to the advancement of education, both domestically and on the international stage. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has set an ambitious target of achieving a 50% Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035, placing a greater responsibility on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to provide quality education and training to a larger student population.
Chandigarh University, guided by its motto "to discover, learn, and empower," is resolutely committed to offering students an unparalleled educational experience. The university's programs are meticulously designed to be flexible, experiential, and interdisciplinary, enabling students to delve into their interests and cultivate the skills necessary for success in their chosen fields.

A pedagogy to imbibe holistic development in each and every learner to harness goodness factor in his/her entire career with a positive mind is the hallmark of CU education. The pandemic might have amplified your concerns regarding learning but we have kept our primary focus on the academics of our students. We have adopted a world-leading Learning Management System to ensure hassle-free and uninterrupted learning when the physical mode of learning is not feasible.


As the Pro Vice Chancellor, I bring a rich diverse experience of academics, research, corporate and defense. That includes having seen 2 IITs, 2 IIITs, 2 private universities, Microsoft IDC, and as CEO of a global IT Company and also as an IAF officer. But my profound passion is higher education, research, and entrepreneurship.

In the world, where the landscapes of technologies and paradigms in all walks of life have been changing fast, it is important for each of us to keep ourselves ahead of the curve, relevant and futuristic. We all academicians and students not only need to keep us updated of the latest developments in respective fields, but possibly also be contributors to these domains.

My doors are open to you always. May you all continue to be success in your R&D endeavours!

It is a matter of honor and immense pleasure to lead the most prestigious and esteemed Chandigarh University as a Pro-Vice Chancellor- Research.
Driven by exponential progress in Science & Technology (S&T), the world is increasingly moving towards an innovation economy. To be a global leader in S&T, India needs to create pioneering research and develop an ecosystem that supports its translation for the good in sculpting the economy and society, thereby ensuring that our sustained economic growth is not  just service sector centric but uses cutting edge technology applications for the social good. Indian science has done well in the last decade and a half, especially when compared to the last two decades of the 20th century. The first decade of this century saw the second era of scientific institution building, the initial one being the two decades after Independence. Purely by statistics, the quantity and quality of research in STEM is going up but the weaknesses of Indian Science are still as stark as ever in general, barring top notch institutions. This impression can continue to flourish provided the leading institutions like Chandigarh University with a demonstrated history of one century are well furnished with competences to create a sustainable and innovative future.
As I assume the role of steering the University Centre for Research and Development (UCRD) at Chandigarh University, I find it to be a focused unassumingly vibrant unit fostering research eco-system, that cut across all the verticals of S&T per-se, humanities (including commerce), management and all other cognitive sciences, one can think of in such an esteemed instituition of repute. This is being achieved seamlessly by facilitating, planning, implementation, and monitoring of research activities such as information and databases, research publications, patents, sponsored grants, IPRs, international collaborations, and importantly all type of outreach and reachout activities by the faculties, research scholars and other students.
UCRD acts as a facilitator for the various schools and departments to promote inter-disciplinary, trans-disciplinary, and multidisciplinary research culture. It is also responsible for developing policies and procedures that govern R&D activities, including ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects or animals, research incentive policies, data management policies, knowledge dissemination policies, networking & collaboration with industries, and institutions of eminense for the benefit of faculty, students, industry and other stakeholders.
Globally speaking there are many R&D funding agencies who do not have specific policies supporting interdisciplinary research. Therefore talking on the subject may be nice, but the need is to walk the talk that too judiciously. The need is also to build a resilient research ecosystem by grooming young talents that can help replenish the void created as a result of superannuated faculties. At the same time, handholding the veterans who continue to be a source of inspiration because of their continued involment in the research for the young minds. Attracting and retaining talent was a challenge long before the pandemic, but the health crisis has reinforced those demands.
To reimagine and redesign an innovative research ecosystem in the Chandigarh University; the need is to create the strategic roadmaps that are aligned with the aspirational goals of 21st century education. This transformation perhaps is the need of the hour to not only capitalise on innovation, but importantly delivering excellent teaching and learning in line with our NEP 2020.


As the Registrar, I have a distinguished career of more than 18 years as an academician in various Government Colleges and as an Educational Administrator for 10 years with the Directorate of Higher Education to the Government of Punjab where I successfully managed all 13 branches under the Directorate of Higher Education. As a concrete demonstration of extraordinary passion and commitment for my work, I recognise being the strong and proactive part of the University Management.

As the Registrar in Chandigarh University, It takes immense pride in being a part of this esteemed University of Punjab flourished into a beacon of excellence, which is dedicated to academic excellence, research, and the overall development of its students. Chandigarh University has always been committed to nurturing talents, encouraging creativity, and fostering a spirit of innovation among its students. Through our diverse academic programs, state-of-the-art facilities, and experienced faculty members, we strive to provide a vibrant and conducive learning environment for all. Our aim is to empower our students with knowledge and skills that will enable them to excel in their chosen fields and contribute meaningfully to the society.
