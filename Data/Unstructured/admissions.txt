                            Students can now avail a loan of up to Rs. 10 Lakh
                            without collateral.
                          

                          The scheme is restricted to students enrolled in
                          professional/ technical courses only from NAAC
                          accredited Institutions or professional/ technical
                          programmes accredited by NBA or Institutions of
                          National Importance or Central Funded Technical
                          Institutions (CFTIs). Being a NAAC A+ graded
                          Chandigarh University is eligible for CSIS Scheme.
                        

                          CSIS is a unique scheme that pivots around the
                          vision that no student desiring to pursue higher
                          education is denied the opportunity if he/ she is
                          financially poor. Students belonging to Economically
                          Weaker Sections, i.e. students whose annual gross
                          parental income is up to Rs 4.5 lakhs can avail this
                          scheme. The subsidy is admissible only once either
                          for the undergraduate or postgraduate or integrated
                          course. Study loan is provided without any
                          collateral security and third-party guarantee and
                          for a maximum amount of Rs 7.5 lakhs.
                        

                          This scheme was introduced to benefit all categories
                          of economically weaker students who wish to pursue
                          professional/ technical courses in India and intends
                          to provide affordable higher education. The motive
                          is to uplift the students from the grassroots level
                          and increase the number of qualified technicians/
                          professionals in the nation.
                        

                              The question should ideally be, why choose an
                              Education Loan over a personal loan, or the
                              money accumulated in your savings account? The

                                        both principal and interest
                                        components. Your EMI would be
                                        calculated depending on the tenor you
                                        choose, to repay your loan. The EMI
                                        would be higher if you choose to repay
                                        within a shorter period as against a
                                        longer-term loan. A shorter repayment
                                        period, however, reduces your interest
                                        cost over the term of the loan. Add

                                        of the course, or the time it takes

                                        Most banks do not levy prepayment
                                        penalty on Study loan. However, it is
                                        best to check with the bank before
                                        signing the dotted line.

                                        becomes easier to get the loan
                                        sanctioned. This is because of your
                                        prior relationship with the bank, your
                                        past financial records and
