I always found it hard to balance my studies and focus on my game side by side. Campus Life at Chandigarh University really helped me to keep a track on both them while I also worked on enhancing my skills in the sport. CU has taught me that the Sky's the Limit.
I owe it to my teachers who have always motivated me and I’m now serving in one of the oldest and most decorated armoured regiments of the Indian Army. Life at CU campus has helped me grow and achieve my dreams inspired by my parents.
You need some good mentorship to make it to the international level and Chandigarh University has always provided me with the best mentorship. I am now proudly representing our country in the field of Boxing.
Chandigarh University and our NCC unit has been very motivating throughout the journey. There are a lot of important things I have learned here and I am thankful for all of them.
I Launched my START UP GEARR TECHNOLOGIES. From the start of my studies at CU, I experienced what industry culture is all about. I got the opportunity to learn via practicals and not theoretical. This practical experience instilled confidence and sharpened my skills and gave the required impetus to secure my career as an entrepreneur. I don't think I would have ever come so far without CU.
CU has induced a lot of confidence in me. I believe in myself and the music I make. The constant encouragement by our faculty and students have been really inspiring. The golden years at CU have always helped grow up as a better individual.
Not only did CU help me in generating innovative ideas but they also helped me getting my idea copyrighted. With constant and whole hearted support from CU, I have also created my own company and my studies and research work at Chandigarh University is helping in staying dedicated towards growing.
From asking questions in the classroom to asking them at one of the largest platforms, CU has always motivated me to keep learning and expressing. Working for India’s leading news channel, I have been confident in my approach and been grabbing every opportunity. I appreciate my UIMS department & CU for the best guidance.
Becoming Miss Tourism Universe and being a TedXYouth Speaker means a lot to me and my days at Chandigarh University have really helped me become the person I am today. The environment at CU is soothing and positive with people from all across the globe.
I think all these opportunities came my way because of Chandigarh University. I would like to thank the faculty and Management of the University because of whose support I was able to achieve such a glorious success.
I want to thank Chandigarh University for giving me such opportunities, faculty staff of UIA for always understanding me and helping me throughout my 5 years of Degree in every aspect of life. I had always dreamt of representing my country India, in any Sports domain. Thank you Chandigarh University for helping live my dream.
My experience at Chandigarh University has been amazing.
